/* To be honest I'm not sure where to start I know you have to find the highest GPA then return that student with the
highest GPA as the valedictorian. Then for the other one you find the amount of trues that come from the boolean
and then put that over the total amount of students and then multiply by 100 and that is your percentage. I would do
this if I knew how but I don't.*/
